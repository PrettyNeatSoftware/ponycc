# ponycc

Pony package for parsing, manipulaing, and compiling Pony code. :horse: :horse:

NOTE: This repo was formerly named `pony-ast` and was dedicated to parsing / AST only, but the scope has now been expanded to also include work on a Pony compiler. The `ast` subpackage is still isolated enough that it can be used independently without having to use the entire compiler.
